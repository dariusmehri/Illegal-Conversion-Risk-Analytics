# Illegal Conversion Risk Analytics

This is a project I managed with the Building Census project located in the office of the Chief Enforcement Officer at the NYC Department of Buildings and the Columbia University sociology department. The goal was to identify buildings in New York City that are at high risk of an illegal conversion. An illegal conversion is when an existing residential or commercial building is altered or modified to create an additional room, space, or unit without first getting approval from the DOB. Illegal conversions are a serious safety risk to residents by creating potentially unsafe living conditions and not complying with Building and Fire Codes. Many fire deaths are caused by illegal conversions because the illegally converted room or unit is often located in a cellar or attic that lack a second egress to escape a fire.
